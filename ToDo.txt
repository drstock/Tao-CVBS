Speedometer App TODO:

- Better filter on raw accel
- Dynamic LPF on Gravity-vector; make filter-response time dependent on magnitude of raw accel-vec: if near 9.8: fast response, else slower response.
- Dynamic reduction-ratio on velocity-vec; inverse to gravity filter response

- implement TransmitService:
	- timestamp velocity values
	- packetize timestamped values in blocks of 60 sec, (ring buffer?)
	- transmit packet every 30 sec.
	? UDP or TCP???

- implement settings as a separate activity:
 	* accel-resampling rate
 	* gravity filter parameters
 	* velocity reduction parametaers?
 	* block-buffer size (in sec)
 	* tx interval (in sec)
 	* target IP-address & port
 	
 ? make GUI nicer? 
 	? visualize 3D vectors?
